# Ushelf - Your Digital Bookshelf

## Introduction

Ushelf is a digital platform designed to help users organize their books and files as they would on a physical shelf at home or in the office. With Ushelf, you can upload files, arrange them digitally, and invite others to view and access your shelves. The platform ensures the safety and accessibility of your files from any device, anywhere.
